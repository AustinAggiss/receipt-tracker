# Receipt Tracker
  
This is a project vibe coded with [Chef](https://chef.convex.dev) using [Convex](https://convex.dev) as its backend.
It was used as a baseline to create the basic functionality with the Convex backend, and then edited manually to fix some things.
I decided to try and make this project purely because there was no simple option on the market that did what I wanted.

## Features
- 🔍 Search for merchant name, date or invoice total
- 🔁 Reuse previous merchant names via search
- 🌙 Light/Dark mode
- 📱 Clean and simple, responsive (mostly) UI
- 🗃️ All stored on Convex's servers
- 🔒 Secured with Convex Auth (beta)

## Planned (hopefully)
- ❌ Deleting receipts (button doesn't work yet)
- 📅 Fixing date search
- 🧹 Tidying up some inconsistent elements

## Project structure
  
The frontend code is in the `app` directory and is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

The website is automatically built and deployed via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
